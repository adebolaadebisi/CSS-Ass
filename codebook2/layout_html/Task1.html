Debola is currently learning how to build websites, and one of the exciting concepts she’s practicing is the CSS sticky header. A sticky header is a navigation bar that stays at the top of the screen, no matter how much you scroll down the page. It’s a common feature in modern websites because it makes navigation easier and keeps important links always visible.
<ul>

While working on this, Debola has been exploring how different CSS properties work together:
	<li>Using position: fixed; to keep the header locked at the top.</li>
	<li>Adding top: 0; and width: 100%; so the header stretches across the page neatly.</li>
	<li>Applying z-index to make sure the header doesn’t get hidden behind other content.</li>
	<li>Adjusting margin-top on the content area, so the text doesn’t overlap with the header.</li>
   </ul>

    <p></p>This practice is helping Debola understand not just sticky headers, but also the importance of layout, spacing, and user experience in web design. It’s part of her journey to becoming comfortable with HTML and CSS, as she builds confidence in writing clean code and seeing it come alive in the browser.
The sticky header project shows Debola’s determination to learn hands-on — testing, asking questions, and improving her designs step by step. With every experiment, she’s moving closer to creating her own fully functional, well-styled websites.
